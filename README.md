# IT135-8L Project: SMART Doctor Tracking Appointment System üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

### Description

The ‚ÄúSmart Doctor Tracking Appointment System‚Äù being introduced for doctors,
medical clinics, and hospitals would make the booking appointment with the patients easier and
develop a better environment for both doctor and patient. The system provides an online
appointment booking to avail of the medical services of doctors.

This system is exclusively designed to make the life of doctors easy by keeping track and
strictly monitoring their day-to-day tasks and activities of their hectic life. It also contains a
booking online for patients who can be accepted, rescheduled, or referred to another specialist by
the doctor based on the doctor‚Äôs line-up of activities.

This system also aims to offer a ‚ÄúPatient Booking Appointment System ‚Äù for doctors that
would make it easy for patient users in their appointment-scheduling journey and create a better
doctor-patient experience. This proposed system can also eliminate confusion about the
customary appointment services, especially now that many people are afraid to visit hospitals
because of the ongoing pandemic and resort to making online transactions.


The appointment system was created from PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. To run the system,
a virtual server, XAMPP for Windows on our computer. For the test strategies, the test suite
was applied for the various functionalities of the patient/doctor and for the admin.
